# Syntax
## Comments
They are just like in C, except nestable.
```simplex
// Single line comment
/* Multiline comment */
/* /* Nested multiline comment */ */
```
## Whitespace, semicolons and separators
Spaces and tabs are not significant, newlines are. Semicolons are optional (required for multiple statements on a single line). Keywords `then` and `do` separate condition and body when both are on single line.

<details><summary><b>Separators example</b></summary>
Here `*` could mean dereference or multiplication:

<!--
"<pre data-role="codeBlock" data-info="simplex" class="language-simplex simplex"><code>if condition  *pointer = 42
</code></pre>"
-->

```simplex
if condition  *pointer = 42
```

To disambiguate you can:
* Use `then` keyword:
  ```simplex
  if condition then *pointer = 42
  ```
* Use braces:
  ```simplex
  if condition { *pointer = 42 }
  ```
* Put body on new line:
  ```simplex
  if condition
      *pointer = 42
  ```
</details>

## Expressions
### Primary
#### Names (Identifiers)
A sequence of characters that starts with `_` or `a-Z`, and continues with `_` or ` ` (space, experimental) or `a-Z` or `0-9`.
I'm experimenting with multi-word names. For example
`hello world` is a single identifier, like `hello_world`. If there are multiple spaces between names, they are not merged and treated as two separate tokens.
...
I think only one space should be allowed. That way there will not be different text that results in same name, which helps with search. If there are multiple spaces, treat as two separate names, this can reduce separator usage (`then`/`do`).
#### None literal
`none`
A value that represents nothing. 
Has type `None`, which is like `void` in C.
It is implicitly convertible to:
* Pointers
* ðŸš§ Options
Explicitly it is convertible to any type, resulting in all bytes being set to zero, equivalent to `memset(&value, 0, sizeof(value))`

---
#### Boolean Literal
`true`
`false`

Type: `Bool`.

---
#### Integer Literal
`69` - decimal
`069` - invalid, use `0o` for octal
`0x45` - hexadecimal
`0o105` - octal
`0b0100_0101` - binary

Use underscore `_` as a separator.

Type: `UnsizedInteger`, which is implicitly convertible to any sized integer type if there is no data loss. See [Unsized Integer](#unsizedinteger) for more details.

---
#### String literal
```simplex
"Hello, world!\n"
```
Enclosed in double quotes `"`. Escaped with backslash `\`. Supports hex bytes using `\xFF`. Terminates only when encoutering unescaped double quote `"`, meaning that multiline literals just work. Line endings are not changed, so they are whatever is in your source file () (ðŸš§ user-defined line endings might be useful?). 

---
#### Definition
```simplex
var x = 42
const y: Int = 690
let condition = true
```
`: Type` is optional when initial value is provided.
`var` - runtime variable.
`let` - runtime immutable.
`const` - compile time constant.

ðŸš§ Definitions are *expressions*, meaning you can place them in unusual places, for example in `if` conditions:

```simplex
if let found = find(array, needle) {
    println(*found)
}
```

##### Shorthands
Definitions that closely represent the AST look like this:
```simplex
const my_function = fn () {}
```
This syntax is a bit cumbersome, so there is an easier way:
```simplex
fn my_function() {}
```
This is transformed into the version above, so they are identical.
This currently works for `fn` and `struct`.

---
#### Block
Block is a list of statements, last of which can be an expression. Statements are executed in order. Value of last expression is the result.
```simplex
{
    statement1;
    statement2;
    result_expression;
}
```
If last statement of a block is an expression, the block itself becomes an expression:
```simplex
let foo = {
    println("something")
    42
}
```
Here "something" is printed, then `42` is assigned to `foo`.

---
#### If Expression
```simplex
var result = if condition then true_branch() else false_branch()
```
If expression must have both branches, and both of them must be expressions, not statements. Branches' type must be the same.

---
#### Match expression
Table from value to code
```
var color_string = match color {
    0 => "black"
    1 => "white"
    else => "unknown"
}
```
`match` is mostly eqivalent to a series of `if`s:
```
var color_string = {:a
    if color == 0 then break :a "black"
    if color == 1 then break :a "white"
    "unknown"
}
```
In some cases compiler may introduce a jump table.

Match expression yields a value. If there's no matching case, and no default case, `debug_break()` is executed, which will stop the program.

---
#### Lambda Head
```simplex
fn (arg: Type): Ret
```
Lambda head is a type. It has parameters and return type. If you follow LambdaHead with a body it turns into a Lambda.

---
#### Lambda
```simplex
fn (arg: Type): ReturnType => body
fn (arg: Type) body                // return type is inferred from body
```
Lambda's type is its head. Lambda's body is executed when you call it. Any expression can be the body.
ðŸš§ What should the result type of `typeof lambda`?
1. Generic function type, to which any lambda with matching signature can be implicitly casted.
1. Unique function type that only that lambda has.

Some examples:
```
fn foo(x: Int): Int
fn eval(func: typeof foo, x: Int) => func(x)
eval(foo, 42)
```
Here you probably want the first option so eval can accept lambdas other than foo.

```simplex

fn foo(x: Int): Int
fn eval[T](func: T, x: Int) => func(x)
eval(foo, 42)
```
Here you probably want the second option so inlining works
...
though that might be solved by constant propagation.
probably just stick with first one. idk.

## Statements
### If Statement
```simplex
if condition {
    true_branch()
} else {
    false_branch()
}
```
Unlike if expression, branches of if statement can be either statements or expressions. `else` branch can be omitted.

---
### Match statement
```simplex
match thing {
    0 => {
        println("Thing is zero")
    }
    1 => {
        // do some stuff
    }
}
```
Match statements are not required to be complete: if a case is missing, nothing will happen.

## Types
### `Type`
The type of all types.
ðŸš§ Values of type `Type` store information about some type, e.g. name, size, alignment, members, arguments etc.

---
### `None`
The type of `none` literal. It is like `void` in C.
Lambdas that do not return anything have this return type.

---
### `Bool`
May have one of two values: `true` or `false`

---
### `U8` / `U16` / `U32` / `U64` / `S8` / `S16` / `S32` / `S64`
Two's complement integer of N bits.
If there is no way data could be lost, one is implicitly convertible to another.
Otherwise implicit attempt will result in an error.

---
### `String`
A structure like this:
```simplex
const String = struct {
    data: *U8
    count: Int
}
```

---
### ðŸš§ `Range`
```simplex
const Range = struct [T: Type] {
    begin: T
    end: T
}
```

Ranges can represent a consecutive set of integers:
```simplex
var range: Range[Int] = 0..10  // 10 is not included
for it in range do println(it) // prints 0 1 2 ... 9
```
or a memory span:
```simplex
var string = .["hello", "world"]
var span: Range[*String] = strings
```
```simplex
fn get_count[T: Type](range: Range[T]) {
    range.end - range.begin
}
```
```simplex
const String = Range[*U8]
```

---
### Arrays
```simplex
[count]Int
```
`count` must be `const`. Arrays implicitly convert to [ranges](#range)

---
### Pointers
```simplex
*String
```

---
### Function types
```simplex
fn (a: Arg1, b: Arg2): ReturnType
```

---
### Aliases
`Int` = `S64`
`UInt` = `US64`

### Internal
#### `UnsizedInteger`
A signed 64-bit number
